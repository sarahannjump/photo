    <h1 class="story-title">Love Is Not A Memory</h1>
    <p class="p-3 subtitle">Throughout their 57 years of marriage, Karen and Ed Young have made a home together, raised seven children, and seen Ed through a cancer diagnosis. Now their days begin with Ed reminding Karen who she is and telling her about the life they&#x27;ve built. Karen has advanced dementia and Ed is her devoted caregiver— though he prefers the word husband.</p>

      <p class="caption-2">&quot;My brain is letting me down...&quot; Karen wrote in her journal on August 29, 2008. When Karen began noticing symptoms of dementia, she started a journal to document her progression. Nearly a decade later, Karen can no longer communicate beyond a handful of phrases. This project includes images created from scans of Karen&#x27;s journal and Ed&#x27;s notes.</p>

    <div class="photo-cap"><img src="../images/03_Love.jpeg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 991px) 100vw, (max-width: 2857px) 70vw, 2000px" srcset="../images/03_Love-p-500.jpeg 500w, ../images/03_Love-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, ../images/03_Love-p-1600.jpeg 1600w, ../images/03_Love.jpeg 2000w" alt="">
      <p class="caption-2">Wearing giant sunglasses, Ed tries to engage Karen as they sit on their porch swing. Though Karen didn&#x27;t respond, Ed has learned not to get discouraged. When doing something silly or dancing doesn&#x27;t work, he gives Karen playing cards, toys, cash, or catalogs to keep her entertained.<br><br>&quot;At the very beginning, it would agitate me and I would be so worried,&quot; Ed said. &quot;Now, I usually go with the flow.”</p>
    </div>
    <div class="photo-cap"><img src="../images/love3.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 991px) 100vw, (max-width: 2800px) 70vw, 1960px" srcset="../images/love3-p-500.jpeg 500w, ../images/love3-p-800.jpeg 800w, ../images/love3-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, ../images/love3-p-1600.jpeg 1600w, ../images/love3.jpg 1960w" alt="">
      <p class="caption-2">Ed believes that caring for Karen in the home they&#x27;ve shared for over 50 years has helped her to live longer and be happier. On the wall hangs enlarged photographs of them as teenagers: attending the high school basketball sectional at Huntingburg Memorial Gym in 1957 and swimming at Lincoln State Park during the summer of 1958.<br><br>&quot;She&#x27;s got my going steady ring around her neck,&quot; Ed pointed out. &quot;Going steady meant she was my girl.&quot;</p>

      <p class="caption-2">Ed tries to coax Karen into rising from the bed to bathe. When giving Karen a sponge bath, Ed wears medical gloves for hygiene reasons. Karen also needs assistance to use the bathroom due to incontinence.<br><br>“It’s a terrible, terrible disease. It deprives you of life,&quot; Ed said about dementia. &quot;It deprives you of your personality. It deprives you of just taking care of yourself.&quot;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="photo-cap"><img src="../images/l5.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 991px) 100vw, 70vw" srcset="../images/l5-p-800.jpeg 800w, ../images/l5.jpg 1024w" alt="" class="handwriting">
      <p class="caption-2">&quot;My Eddie, I have changed and we&#x27;re both SCARED. My need for you is more than at any time of our marriage. I need you,&quot; Karen wrote in a note to Ed, which she copied into her journal on August 19, 2008.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="photo-cap"><img src="../images/l6.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 991px) 100vw, (max-width: 3657px) 70vw, 2560px" srcset="../images/l6-p-500.jpeg 500w, ../images/l6-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, ../images/l6-p-1600.jpeg 1600w, ../images/l6-p-2000.jpeg 2000w, ../images/l6.jpg 2560w" alt="">
      <p class="caption-2">“Whenever I&#x27;m undressing her, she fights me. I can imagine what&#x27;s going through her mind and then I try to ease her mind,&quot; Ed said. “At the time, she might not realize it’s me, her husband, in there helping her. She might think it’s somebody else or that somebody’s attacking her.” Ed patiently reassures Karen with a constant stream of &quot;everything&#x27;s going to be okay&quot; in a calm and even tone as she cries out while he puts on her night gown.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="photo-cap"><img src="../images/08_love.jpeg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 991px) 100vw, (max-width: 2857px) 70vw, 2000px" srcset="../images/08_love-p-500.jpeg 500w, ../images/08_love-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, ../images/08_love-p-1600.jpeg 1600w, ../images/08_love.jpeg 2000w" alt="">
      <p class="caption-2">&quot;Just like a little kid,&quot; Ed said. &quot;That&#x27;s what they do. They put things in their mouth.&quot; He quickly intercepts as Karen goes in for a taste of money. Ed learned to keep a careful eye on her after an incident last year where Karen swallowed three quarters and needed to have them surgically removed.</p>

      <p class="caption-2">This popular quote from an unknown author resonated with the Young family. Ed wrote the quote in the beginning of a journal he started for his children to share as a way to express their feelings.</p>
    </div>

      <p class="caption-2">&quot;She still shows a lot of love,&quot; Ed said. &quot;She likes to hold hands a lot. She likes to be close and loved.&quot; Among Karen&#x27;s most frequently used phrases are &quot;kiss me&quot; and &quot;I love you&quot;.</p>
    </div>

      <p class="caption-2">“I’m not &#x27;sharp&#x27;. My head now is feeling like a mixing bowl— It’s swishing inside and seems like its going around and around. It’s pulsatory inside my head. That happens when I want to use my brain,” Karen wrote in her journal on September 30, 2008.</p>

    <div class="photo-cap"><img src="../images/13_love.jpeg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 991px) 100vw, (max-width: 2857px) 70vw, 2000px" srcset="../images/13_love-p-500.jpeg 500w, ../images/13_love-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, ../images/13_love-p-1600.jpeg 1600w, ../images/13_love.jpeg 2000w" alt="">
      <p class="caption-2">Karen and Ed are part of a group of friends that meets weekly for dinner. Over the years, they have watched the progression of Karen&#x27;s dementia. At Applebee&#x27;s, Ed made sure that Karen was seated next to a friend so that she had the potential for social interaction. Ed used to get embarrassed if Karen caused a scene while eating out, but he no longer lets it bother him. Ed has become a source of encouragement for another member of the group to bring their spouse with dementia out more often.</p>

      <p class="caption-2">Karen often expresses distress when Ed puts her to bed.<br><br>&quot;I noticed that when I pray out loud, she settles down. I say the Hail Mary and Our Father. I keep saying it, saying it out loud to her and it just seems to soothe her and settle her down,” Ed said.<br><br>He usually takes some time to himself before joining her for the night. Ed has never considered sleeping separately, even though Karen often wets the bed.<br></p>

      <p class="caption-2">When Ed looks at his wife, he doesn&#x27;t see her disease.<br><br>&quot;I see a wonderful person, the mother of our seven kids and how much she had to labor over the years...She&#x27;s done so much for so many people,” Ed said. Though he admits, “Every once in a while I think she&#x27;s just going to snap out of it.&quot;</p>

      <p class="caption-2">&quot;It’s a big learning experience. You have to make a total commitment to not only take care of them, but to take care of yourself. You don&#x27;t know all this stuff at the very beginning,” Ed said. He prays for strength, patience and understanding at St. Joseph Catholic Church. “I ask for the power to do what I need to do, not knowing what tomorrow will bring.”<br></p>
