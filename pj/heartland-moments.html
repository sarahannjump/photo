      <p class="caption-2">Faith Brawley kisses her granddaughter, Quinn King, 3, as Gema King, 4, talks to Faith&#x27;s daughter, Becca King, an inmate at the Dubois County Security Center in Jasper, Indiana.  Becca has since been sentenced to prison on drug-related charges and plans on participating in a program to treat her addiction. Faith, a recovering drug addict, acknowledges that there is a genetic factor in addiction that her granddaughters will have to face and that they will struggle to break the cycle if their parents are unable to stay clean. “I hate that,” Faith said. “My addiction— even though it has come to an end— what it did to their mother caused her to pick who she picked, caused her to live the way she lives and it causes her cycle to continue and it causes them to, more than likely, be involved in the cycle of addiction themselves.”</p>

      <p class="caption-2">Tina and her daughter, Annabelle, share a laugh as Rachel watches in her car&#x27;s rearview mirror on their way to Tina&#x27;s chemotherapy appointment in Evansville, Indiana. Both women shaved their heads at a fundraiser for Tina&#x27;s breast cancer treatment. While their friendship came and went over the years, much like the cycles of drug addiction and domestic violence they had both experienced, Rachel was by Tina&#x27;s side during her last days in hospice.</p>

      <p class="caption-2">“I spend more time with my animals than I do with humans,” Angel Lange said.
